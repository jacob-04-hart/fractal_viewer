The "Split Koch" or "3D Koch Curve" is an attempt to extend the Koch Snowflake curve into a third dimension. It is constructed recursively, starting with a delta shape formed by two tetrahedrons glued to each other. The shape can be split into 3 similar shapes by taking 3 slices out of it. This process can be done repeatedly to generate an approximation of the Split Koch. A true Split Koch fractal would be infinitely detailed (which would require a lot of compute time). There is another way to try and extend the Koch Snowflake to 3D that takes a more constructive approach and it looks quite different. Find it under "Koch Tetrahedron" and some neat variants under "Checkered Koch" and "Pointy Koch". I should note that the Split Koch requires a less intensive algorithm to create than these other ones, so your CPU can probably handle higher recursive depths.
